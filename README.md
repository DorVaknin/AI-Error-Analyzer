# AI-Powered Error Analysis System

## Description

This project implements an advanced error analysis system utilizing AI and machine learning techniques. It features a flexible embedding service that can switch between OpenAI and Xenova models, demonstrating adaptability to different AI technologies. The system integrates with Pinecone, a vector database, for efficient storage and retrieval of code snippets based on semantic similarity.

## Key Features

- Flexible embedding service supporting OpenAI and Xenova models
- Integration with Pinecone vector database for efficient code snippet retrieval
- Azure OpenAI integration for cloud-based AI capabilities
